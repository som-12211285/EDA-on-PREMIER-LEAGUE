## 📊 Key Insights (Example Highlights)

After performing thorough EDA and visualizing various aspects of the Premier League dataset, here are the major insights obtained:

### 📈 1. Correlation Heatmap
- Strong positive correlation between **shots on target** and **goals scored**, indicating shooting accuracy plays a key role.
- A mild negative correlation between **fouls committed** and **points earned**, suggesting that disciplined teams often perform better.

### 📦 2. Boxplots
- **Goals scored** have a few significant outliers — indicating occasional high-scoring matches or standout players.
- **Yellow cards** are more consistently distributed, with most teams falling within a typical range, but a few overly aggressive teams stand out.

### 🏟️ 3. Home vs Away Performance
- Home teams tend to win more matches than away teams, confirming the traditional **home advantage** trend.
- Away teams have slightly fewer goals on average.

### 🧍 4. Player-Level Analysis
- Top goal scorers also lead in shots taken and minutes played, highlighting the importance of regular playtime.
- A few players accumulate high assists with fewer goals, indicating their role as creative playmakers.

### 🛑 5. Defensive Statistics
- Teams with higher **clearances and tackles** often finish mid-table — showing that strong defense alone may not ensure top position.
- **Goalkeepers' saves** were highest in lower-ranked teams, indicating defensive pressure and fewer clean sheets.
